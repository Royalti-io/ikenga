## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Harden pane/pin screenshot capture so it can no longer freeze or crash the WebKitGTK renderer. Pane capture now prefers a native window-crop (capture the window via the OS tool, crop to the pane's rect with the `image` crate) and only falls back to the synchronous `modern-screenshot` DOM clone when the pane has its own off-screen content — and that fallback is gated by a node-count ceiling that declines cleanly instead of attempting a clone large enough to trip the JSC watchdog. Native-crop validates the captured PNG against the window's outer size before trusting the crop and caches an "unreliable" verdict per compositor (e.g. focus-dependent `gnome-screenshot -w`) so later captures skip the doomed probe. Also: Windows window-capture now falls back to the FE path instead of hard-erroring; the iyke screenshot CLI timeout is raised 15s→70s; and a dropped `log::warn!` in the global-shortcut registration is switched to `tracing::warn!`.
- Slim install size: stop bundling the ~89 MB Bun runtime in release artifacts (deb/AppImage/dmg/nsis) and resolve it at runtime instead (env `IKENGA_BUN_PATH` → version-gated system `bun` ≥ 1.3.14 → cached fetched bun with SHA-pin → post-launch background fetch with a progress chip; sha256-verified before unzip, no-strike park while fetching). Add `[profile.release]` strip + thin LTO so the binary itself is smaller across every target. The app boots and runs without bun; only bun-backed sidecars wait for the background fetch. Offline/air-gapped installs documented (system bun, drop-in binary, `IKENGA_BUN_PATH`).
